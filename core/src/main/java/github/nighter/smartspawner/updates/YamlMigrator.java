/**
 * Generic, version-less YAML migrator that runs on every startup for every config / language file.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the old {@code config_version}-based updater, this keeps the user's file exactly as it is
 * (values <em>and</em> comments) and only ever <em>adds</em> what is missing. There is no version
 * number to bump, no full-file rewrite, and no backup churn – the file is only written when something
 * actually changed.</p>
 *
 * <p>What it does, in order:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Strip legacy version keys ({@code config_version} / {@code language_version} /
 *       {@code gui_layout_version}) left over from the old system.</li>
 *   <li>Apply key renames – transfer the user's old value to the new key name.</li>
 *   <li>Run an optional {@link CustomMigration} for anything renames can't express
 *       (conditional value rewrites, pattern-based key moves, ...).</li>
 *   <li>Add missing keys – fill in any key absent from the user's file with the bundled default,
 *       carrying its comments across too. Sections marked by an {@link OwnedSection} are skipped,
 *       because their contents are a list the user curates.</li>
 *   <li>Write to disk – only when at least one change was made.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>User values for existing, unchanged keys are NEVER touched.</p>
