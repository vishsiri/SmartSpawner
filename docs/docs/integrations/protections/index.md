# Protections and Claims

Protection hooks are **automatic**. There is no toggle in `config.yml`. When a supported protection plugin is present, SmartSpawner asks it before three actions:

- **Open menu**: right-click a spawner to open the GUI.
- **Stack**: add spawners to a stack.
- **Break**: mine or remove a spawner.

The flag or trust level that allows each action lives inside the protection plugin, not inside SmartSpawner. Pick your plugin below for the exact settings.

::: tip Who bypasses every check
Operators and players with the `*` wildcard permission (plus `worldguard.region.bypass` for WorldGuard) skip all protection checks. Test with a regular player account.
