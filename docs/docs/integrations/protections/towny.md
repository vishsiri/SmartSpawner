Towny has no per-spawner flag in this integration. Access is decided purely by town membership.

| Action | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Open menu | Resident or trusted resident of the town |
| Stack | Resident or trusted resident of the town |
| Break | Resident or trusted resident of the town |

## How it works

- A player may open, stack, or break a spawner only if they are a **resident** of the town that owns the plot, or a **trusted resident** of that town.
- Outside any town, spawners are unrestricted.
- The town's own `switch` and `destroy` permission lines are **not** consulted for this check. Membership is what matters.

## Grant access

Add the player to the town, or trust them:

```bash
/town add <player>
/town trust add <player>
```
