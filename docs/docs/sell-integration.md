title: Sell Integration
---

# Sell Integration

The `sell_integration.yml` file is located in `plugins/SmartSpawner/`. It controls the sell button in spawner storage: which economy plugin gets used, where prices come from, and what each item is worth.

Everything in this file applies on `/ss reload`.

## Where prices come from

SmartSpawner has two price sources. A shop plugin, if one is installed, and the price list in this file. `price_source_mode` decides which wins.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `SHOP_PRIORITY` | Shop prices first, then the price list as fallback. Recommended. |
| `SHOP_ONLY` | Shop plugin prices only. The price list is ignored. |
| `CUSTOM_PRIORITY` | The price list first, then shop prices as fallback. |
| `CUSTOM_ONLY` | The price list only. Shop prices are ignored. |

If the chosen mode has no working source behind it, selling is disabled and the console says why on startup.

## Checking prices in game

`/ss prices` opens a browser showing the price of every item spawners can drop, and which source each price came from. It is the quickest way to confirm a change landed.

## Upgrading from an older version

Before 1.8.0 these settings were the `sell_integration` section of `config.yml`, and the price list was a separate `item_prices.yml`. Both move into this file automatically on the first start, keeping their values. `item_prices.yml` is deleted once its prices have been copied across.
